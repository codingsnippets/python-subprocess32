------------------

Fixes the references to the 'surrogateescape' unicode encoding error
handler that does not exist in Python 2.x.  'strict' is used so that a
UnicodeEncodeError exception is raised in these situations.  These MAY
occur if your sys.getfilesystemencoding() is not UTF-8 and attempt to
use a non-ascii executable, args or env values.

2012-02-18 3.2.3b1
------------------

This release brings in the last year and a half's worth of bugfixes and
improvements to Python 3.2's subprocess module:

Off the top of my head, some major bugfix highlights include:
 * Timeout support on the APIs.
 * close_fds=True is now the default (as it is in 3.2) and performs much faster.
 * Fixed EINTR handling.
 * Fixed SIGCHLD handling.
 * Fixed several race conditions.
 * Many more bug fixes too numerous to list.
